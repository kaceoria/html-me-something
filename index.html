            <h2>Day Zero</h2>
                <p>"From St. Louis to Toronto, and Toronto to Tokyo, my journey to Japan began.
                The first flight to Toronto was only around two hours, but the flight to Tokyo
                was a whopping 13 hours! Flying with Air Canada, the flight attendants gave
                us cookies on the first flight, and breakfast lunch and dinner, on the second. 
                We left for Tokyo at 10pm and arrived the next day at 4pm."

            <h2>Day One</h2>
                <p>"On our first day in Toyko, we decided to explore the area around Central Tokyo. 
                This is where the main train station is located in Tokyo. We were able to take 
                the subway, the metro, and the bullet train from this main station. From the train
                station, we followed a large group of people and ended up at the imperial palace, which
                is the primary residence of the Emperor of Japan. After leaving the imperial palace, 
                we took the subway to the largest Starbucks reserve in the world. Unfortunately, there
                was a five hour wait to get inside, so instead we walked to get food from a street vendor.
