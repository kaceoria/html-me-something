                    <article>"From St. Louis to Toronto, and Toronto to Tokyo, my journey to Japan began.
                The first flight to Toronto was only around two hours, but the flight to Tokyo
                was a whopping 13 hours! Flying with Air Canada, the flight attendants gave
                us cookies on the first flight, and breakfast lunch and dinner, on the second. 
                We left for Tokyo at 10pm and arrived the next day at 4pm."

                <h2>Day One</h2>
                    <p>"On our first day in Toyko, we decided to explore the area around Central Tokyo. 
                This is where the main train station is located in Tokyo. We were able to take 
                the subway, the metro, and the bullet train from this main station. From the train
                station, we followed a large group of people and ended up at the imperial palace, which
                is the primary residence of the Emperor of Japan. After leaving the imperial palace, 
                we took the subway to the largest Starbucks reserve in the world. Unfortunately, there
                was a five hour wait to get inside, so instead we walked to get food from a street vendor.

                <h2>Day Two</h2>
                 <p>"On Day Two in Tokyo we went to <a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art" target="_blank">The Mori Digital Arts Museum</a>. 
                Although we reserved tickets in advance, we still had to wait in a line that was so long it wrapped around the enire building
                and down the street. The museaum had digital art that you could interact with by stepping on it or
                touching it. They incorportated a lot of lights and colors, and soothing sounds in the background. 
                I was even able to draw a picture that they scanned into a system and then displayed on a large 
                projector that looked like a digital aquarium."

                <h2>Day Three</h2>
                     <p>
                    "On Day Three, we took the bullet train to Kyoto. Kyoto is about a two hour train ride away from Tokyo.
                    Because none of us spoke or read Japanese, we got on the wrong train, and had to get off and wait for the 
                    right train, but we eventually made it to our destination. Our first stop in Kyoto was a bamboo forest. 
                    with the amount of bamboo there, I'm sure its impossible for Pandas to go hungry. Our next and final stop
                    was <a href="http://www.monkeypark.jp/Englishpage.html" target="_blank">Arashiyama Monkey Park.</a> We had to hike 30 minutes up the side of a mountain to get to where the monkeys
                    resided. We were able to feed them from inside if we wanted and we could take pictures, but they told us not 
                    to make eye contact or try to touch them."

                     <p>
                    "Day Four we spent some more time in Tokyo. I went to an owl cafe. The only thing on the menu was owls. We
                    didn't eat the owls, but we did get to hold them and take pictures with them. I ordered a small owl named Mr.
                    Ostrich. He kept giving me the side-eye and I thought he was going to attack me, but he didn't so we were cool.
                    Next we went to Akihabara. It is the part of Tokyo with anime everything. There are tons of buildings with comic
                    book everything, any animated character you can think of, video games, and merchandise for all of it. To end the 
                    night, I met up with friends to do my favorite activity: Dancing! I even missed the last train home because of it. "
